        Welcome to my portfolio! I’m Himani Bansal, a passionate Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my
        Master of Computer Applications (MCA). I thrive on turning ideas into reality through elegant and
        efficient code. My journey into the world of programming started with a curiosity to understand how
        things work behind the scenes on the web. Since then, I have dived deep into technologies like HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks like React.js and Node.js, honing my skills to build responsive
        and dynamic web applications. I am excited about leveraging my academic knowledge and practical
        experience to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects. Currently seeking internships or full-time
        opportunities to further enrich my skills and contribute to impactful projects. Let’s connect and create
        something awesome together!</p>
